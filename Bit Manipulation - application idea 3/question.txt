Description

Given an array A of N positive integers, find the maximum of bitwise ANDs of all subsequences of A with length equal to X.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases, (1<=T<=100).

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integer N, X, (2<=N<=100000), (1<=X<=N).

The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,â€¦,AN, (1<=Ai<=10^9).

 

Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.


Output Format

For each test case print the maximum of bitwise ANDs of all subsequences of A with length equal to X.

Note

1st test case - all subsequence of length X and AND value:
(1,2) - 0
(1,3) - 1
(1,4) - 0
(1,5) - 1
(2,3) - 2
(2,4) - 0
(2,5) - 0
(3,4) - 0
(3,5) - 1
(4,5) - 4
Maximum AND value of all subsequences with length X = 4
