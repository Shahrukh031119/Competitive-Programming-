Description

You have given an array of n numbers and a positive integer m. Lets define c(i, j) = |ai - aj|.
Your task is to find the product of c(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Since this product can be very large, print it with modulo m.


Input Format

The first line contains two integers n, m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 x 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) — number of numbers and modulo.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, …, an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109).


Output Format

Output a single integer.


Sample Input 1

2 10
8 5

Sample Output 1

3

Sample Input 2

3 12
1 4 5

Sample Output 2

0

Note

In the first sample, |8 − 5| = 3 ≡ 3 mod 10.
In the second sample, |1 − 4| ⋅ |1 − 5| ⋅ |4 − 5| = 3 ⋅ 4 ⋅ 1 = 12 ≡ 0 mod12.
