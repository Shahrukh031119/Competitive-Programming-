Description

Your class teacher wrote N integers on the board. One of your classmates was being mischievous, he replaced the N integers with all possible subset sums of the array when the teacher was not in the class. 
Suppose that the integers on the board were [2,1] then the subsets will be: {}, {2}, {1}, {2,1} and the subset sums will be: {0,2,1,3}. 
Your task is to rebuild the original array given by your teacher.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the number of elements in the initial array.
The second line of each test case contains 2N space-separated integers, the new values on the board.


Output Format

For each test case, print N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order.
It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 50
1 ≤ N ≤ 15
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1015


Sample Input 1

3
2
0 1 2 3
3
0 1 3 4 5 6 8 9
3
0 1 1 1 2 2 2 3

Sample Output 1

1 2 
1 3 5 
1 1 1

Note

In the first test case of the example, the original array is [1,2] which has the following subset - {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}. Their respective sums are 0,1,2,3.

In the third test case of the example, the original array is [1,1,1] which has the following subset - {}, {1}, {1}, {1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1,1}. Their respective sums are 0,1,1,1,2,2,2,3.
