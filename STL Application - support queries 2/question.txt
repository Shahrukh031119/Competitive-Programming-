Description

Design a Data Structure which can support the following queries:

Initially, the structure is empty. You have given an integer K. 

The structure is arranged in the order from greater elements to smaller elements. So when we say top K elements, we mean the top K largest elements.

1 x: Add x in structure.

2 x: Remove x from the structure if present in the structure. If x doesn't present in the structure, do nothing. If there are multiple occurrences of x, delete only one occurrence of x.

3 ?: Print the sum of the top K elements. If the structure contains less than K elements, then print the sum of all elements present in the structure. If the structure is empty, then print 0.


Input Format

The first line of input contains Q and K - the number of queries.
Next, Q lines contain queries of the format specified in the statement. 


Output Format

For queries of type 3, print the answer in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ Q, K ≤ 105
0 ≤ x ≤ 109
