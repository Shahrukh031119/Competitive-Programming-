Subarrays are also the subset. Try to think in the direction of subarrays.

Apply Pigeon Hole Principle.

The answer is always YES irrespective of the array.
Consider the pref[i] = (A1 + A2 + ... + Ai) mod N. Base conditions pref[0] = 0.
Observe that there are N + 1 values in the pref array (pref[0], pref[1], ...., pref[N]), but the remainder can take in total N values only (0, 1, ..., N - 1). That means, there exists at least one pair in the pref array which has the same entries.  
Suppose pref[j] == pref[k], and k > j. Then we can conclude that (Aj+1 + ... + Ak) is divisible by N.
Hence, the answer is always YES.
