Description

We are given two equal-length strings S and T. Figure out if we can get string T starting from string S and applying 4 substring reversal operations.


Input Format

The first line contains an integer TC (number of test cases),

The next line contains a string S. 

The next line contains a string T. 


Output Format

For each test case print “YES” if it is possible to form a square fence, else print “NO” without double quotes in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ TC ≤ 10^2
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 40
|T|=|S|

Sample Input 1

2
abacde
beacda
abcdef
abdefc

Sample Output 1

YES
YES

Note

TEST CASE 1:

S = prqs

T = psrq

4 transitions are : 

prqs → pqrs
pqrs → srqp
srqp → srpq
srpq → psrq
 

TEST CASE 2:

S = abdec

T = bdaec

4 transitions are : 

abdec → abced
abced → aecbd
aecbd → bcead
bcead → bdaec
