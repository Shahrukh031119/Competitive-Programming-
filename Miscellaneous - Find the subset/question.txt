Description

You are given a multiset of N integers. Check whether there exists a nonempty subset of it such that the sum of the subset's elements is divisible by N. Otherwise, state that this subset doesn't exist.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test consists of a single integer N - the size of the multiset.
The second line of each test contains N single space-separated integers - the multiset's elements.


Output Format

For each test case, print 'YES' if such a subset exists, otherwise print 'NO'.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109


Sample Input 1

1
3
4 6 10

Sample Output 1

YES

Note

We can pick {6} as the subset, then its sum is 6 and this is divisible by 3 - the size of the initial multiset.
