Description

You have given an array of length N, and a number X. Find the number of subsets with the sum of elements less than equal to X.

Note:

The sum of elements in an empty subset is 0.
The set may contain duplicates elements.

Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated numbers N and X.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.  


Output Format

Print the number of subsets with a sum less than equal to X in a new line for each test case.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 35
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 104
0 ≤ X ≤ 106


Sample Input 1

2
2 1
1 2
3 8
2 2 6

Sample Output 1

2
7

Note

Explanation 1:
The subsets are {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}. The number of subsets with sum ≤ 1 is 2.

Explanation 2:
The subsets are {}, {2}, {2}, {6}, {2, 2}, {2, 6}, {2, 6}, {2, 2, 6} The number of subsets with sum ≤ 8 is 7.
