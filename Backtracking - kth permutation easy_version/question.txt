Description

For the given n, consider the array A = {1, 2, …, n}. There exist n! unique permutations of the array. When we list all these n! permutations in lexicographically order, your task is to find kth permutation in that list.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k.


Output Format

Print n space-separated integers, denoting the kth permutation.


Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 9
1 ≤ k ≤ n!


Sample Input 1

3 4

Sample Output 1

2 3 1

Sample Input 2

4 9

Sample Output 2

2 3 1 4

Note

Explanation 1: All 9 permutations in lexicographic order are

1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
3 2 1
The 4th one is {2, 3, 1}.
