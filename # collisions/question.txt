Description

There are N balls on the X-axis and M balls on the Y-axis. At the time, t=0, each ball on X-axis is thrown parallel to the Y-axis in the positive Y direction. Similarly, each ball on Y-axis is thrown parallel to the X-axis in the positive X direction. At any time, if two balls collide, they disappear. A collision can only happen between the ball thrown from X-axis and the ball thrown from Y-axis. No two balls from X-axis or Y-axis can collide. A ball can take part in at max one collision. You have to find the total number of collisions. 


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M - the number of balls on the X-axis and Y-axis respectively.
For each test case, N lines follow. The i-th of the line contains two space-separated integers Xi and Ui, the position and speed of the i-th ball respectively.
For each test case, M lines follow. The i-th of the line contains two space-separated integers Yi and Vi, the position and speed of the i-th ball respectively.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of collisions on a separate line.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at t=1 the balls collide. The number of collisions is 1.

In the second test case of the example, at t=1, the first ball on X-axis and the first ball on Y-axis collide and disappear. The number of collisions is 1.

In the third test case of the example, at t=⅓, the second ball on X-axis and the first ball on Y-axis collide and disappear. At t=1, the first ball on X-axis and the second ball on Y-axis collide and disappear. The number of collisions is 2.
